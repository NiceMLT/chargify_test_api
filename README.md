# chargify_test_api

before running tests, in a separate terminal `.bin/fake-server` this will enable you to hit the fake-server I've copied and modified a little so that you can see the responses.  Note that the fake server returns random responses and doesn't accept any parameters so you can't actually pass in any fake CC info or anything to check validity.
